//Create a contributors / credits page

//We can list and manually put all contributors and creditors who have contributed into a credits page first. 



//Then we can make a function so that whenever a person contributes (For example a successful pull request/other contributions), they are then added to the page. 


//This can take the contribution
const newContribution = 'pullRequest';


//Taking the person's data, for example name, github link, etc.
function getData() {
    
} 

//The function for updating the page
function updatePage() {
    if (newContribution) {
        updatePage();
    }



}





//There can also be a notification telling the contributor they are on the creditor page
